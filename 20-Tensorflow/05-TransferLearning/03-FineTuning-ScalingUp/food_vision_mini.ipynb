    "1. Download and prepare 10% of Food101 Data (10 % Of training data)\n",
    "  * https://storage.googleapis.com/ztm_tf_course/food_vision/101_food_classes_10_percent.zip\n",
    "2. Training a feature extration transfer learning model on 10% of Food101 training data\n",
    " * Train and Test Data Split\n",
    " * Model Setup\n",
    "   * A **ModelCheckpoint** callback to save progress during training.\n",
    "   * Data Augmentation Layer.\n",
    "   * A headless (no top layer) **EfficientNetB0** architechture from **tf.keras.applications** as out base model.\n",
    "   * A Dense layer with 101 hiddent neurons (same as number of food classes) and sofmax activation as output layer.\n",
    "   * Categorical Cross Entropy as the loss function.\n",
    "   * Adam for optimizer.\n",
    "   * Fit for 5 epochs and evalate on 15% of test data.\n",
    "3. Fine tuning feature extraction model.\n",
    "  * Make the last 5 layers as trainable starting from the last checkpoint.\n",
    "  * Compile and Fit for another 5 epochs starting from last checkpoint.\n",
    "4. Saving and loading our trained model.\n",
    "5. Evaluate Performance of our Food Vision model trained on 10% of Food101 training data\n",
    "  * accuracy score\n",
    "  * confusion matrix\n",
    "  * classification report\n",
    "  * bar chart for F1 score\n",
    "  * Visualize prediction on test images.\n",
    "6. Finding our model worst wrong predictions\n",
    "  * Get the first 20 wrong prediction with high prediction probability\n",
